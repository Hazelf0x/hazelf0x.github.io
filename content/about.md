I'm a lone fox from Finland, I'm 25 years old.

I go by the username Hazelfox (or Hazelf0x depending on availability).

I'm a futures trader by profession.

On my free time I like to do various things like:


* <span style="color:white">cooking</span>
* <span style="color:coral">programming</span> (i suck at it though)
* <span style="color:royalblue">drawing</span> (i also suck at this)
* <span style="color:gold">making music</span> (you guessed it, i suck)
* <span style="color:green">hiking</span>
* <span style="color:crimson">pentesting and doing CTFs</span>

I'll post some stuff here about my hobbies occasionally.

Oh, and if you're wondering about the domain name, I just thought it was funny.
