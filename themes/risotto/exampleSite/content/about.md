I'm a lone fox from Finland, I'm 25 years old.
I go by the username Hazelfox (or Hazelf0x depending on availability).
I'm a futures trader by profession, on my free time I like to do various things like:

* cooking
* programming (i suck at it though)
* drawing (i also suck at this)
* making music (you guessed it, i suck)
* hiking
* learning pentesting and doing CTFs

I'll post some stuff here about my hobbies occasionally.

Oh, and if you're wondering about the domain name, I just thought it was funny.
